# CEO Speaker Script: Project Phalanx
**Role:** Senior Strategic Partner, McKinsey & Company  
**Audience:** Criteo Executive Committee (ExCo)  
**Date:** January 11, 2026  
**Format:** 10-Minute Strategic Briefing

## 🟢 SLIDE 1: Title
**(Visual: "COMPETITIVE STRATEGY: DEFENDING MARKET")**

**Speaker Notes:**
Gentlemen, right now our P&L says we are safe. But the data says we are standing on a cliff.
We have discovered that **77% of our revenue** sits with just **10% of our clients**.
And precisely 20 of those "Whale" accounts are actively testing our competitors today.
If we lose just *one* of them—Client A—we miss our global Q1 target.
**We are not here to discuss "market share"; we are here to discuss survival.**

## 🟢 SLIDE 2: Strategic Executive Brief
**(Visual: "Situation / Complication / Resolution" Memo)**

**Speaker Notes:**
Gentlemen, Slide 2 is the strategy in a single page. 
**The Situation:** On paper, we are market leaders. In reality, we are bleeding in the deep water.
**The Complication:** That **+27%** competitor growth is not random market noise. It is a **"Sniper Attack"** targeting our top 10% of clients.
**The Resolution:** We must pivot from "Blanket Defense" to "Surgical Strike". We are here to authorize **Project Phalanx**.

## 🟢 SLIDE 3: Situation Assessment
**(Visual: "The €132M Opportunity")**

**Speaker Notes:**
Here is the bottom line.
**The Risk:** We have **€1.4B** in gross revenue exposed to competitors.
**The Reality:** The "Efficiency Trap" is real. Competitors are not 'carpet bombing' the market; they are **'sniping'** our most valuable assets.
**The Opportunity:** We have identified **€76.9M** in "Bleeding Revenue" that is addressable immediately.
**The Response:** We are proposing **Project Phalanx**: A 3-pillar strategy to DEFEND our Whales, FORTIFY our Core, and DETECT threats before they become churn.

## 🟢 SLIDE 4: Threat Evolution
**(Visual: "Competitors Now Capture ≥27.1% of Click Share")**

**Speaker Notes:**
This chart tells the story of the attack.
For years, the threat was dormant (5%). Then, in **April 2023**, it exploded.
Competitors have gained **+21.3 points** of click share.
**Key Insight:** They are growing at **+27% YoY** (Oct '23 -> Oct '24). If we do nothing, they become a "replacement" option within 18 months.

## 🟢 SLIDE 5: Competitor Launches (Trajectory)
**(Visual: "Competitive Penetration Has Reached 13.2%...")**

**Speaker Notes:**
A fair question: Is this just normal churn? Are they winning a client and then losing them?
**No.**
This "Layer Cake" chart proves stickiness. Keep your eye on the **Blue area** (2022 Cohort). It’s not shrinking. That means the clients they won three years ago... they *kept*.
**Key Insight:** The threat is **layering**. They are retaining their wins and effectively occupying new territory every quarter.

## 🟢 SLIDE 6: Market Landscape (Fortress vs. Flank)
**(Visual: "Southern Europe Bleeds Fastest")**

**Speaker Notes:**
Geographically, the war is asymmetric.
**Fortress Markets (UK, FR):** We are safe. Low risk.
**Flank Markets (ES, IT, Eastern Europe):** We are bleeding. Spain is at **34%** competitor share. Eastern Europe at **27.5%**.
**The Russia Anomaly:** You see Russia with **38% Click Share** (Volume) but only **0.8% Detection** (Reach).
*Interpretation:* This is a **Sniper Attack**. They are only in a handful of massive accounts. We will MONITOR Russia, but we must FIGHT in Spain.

---

## 🟢 SLIDE 7: Market Perception (Sentiment Gap)
**(Visual: "The Legacy Giant vs Agile Challengers")**

**Speaker Notes:**
The data tells us *what* is happening. The sentiment analysis tells us *why*.
**Criteo:** We are seen as "Unrivaled Scale" but "Expensive & Bureaucratic."
**Challengers:** They are seen as "Agile," offering "Black Box" performance that outperforms us in specific niches.
**The Gap:** We are losing on SERVICE. Smaller clients feel ignored ("Ghost Support"). This is why we need to automate the Core (Fortify) to free up humans for the Whales (Defend).

---

## 🟢 SLIDE 8: Risk Waterfall (Net Value Bridge)
**(Visual: "Waterfall Chart: Red is Risk, Green is Action")**

**Speaker Notes:**
**This bridge shows exactly what is at stake.**
The **Red Bars** represent the €132M we *will* lose if we do nothing:
1.  **-€92.5M** from Bleeding Markets.
2.  **-€39.5M** from Key Account defections.
The **Green Bar** is the impact of Project Phalanx:
*   We recapture **+€23.7M** immediately by locking the Whales.
**The Bottom Line:** We cannot save everything (gray area), but we *must* secure the green bar to hit Q1 targets.
We found **20 Whales** that make up 60% of our risk.
Look at **"Client A (Travel)"**.
This single client is worth **€3.5M/year** (with a peak month of **€215k**).
They are essentially managing a "Split Test" between Criteo and Google/RTB House.
**If we lose Client A, we miss our Global Q1 targets.** Period.

## 🟢 SLIDE 9: Recommendation (Project Phalanx)
**(Visual: "Bifurcated Defense: White Glove vs AI")**

**Speaker Notes:**
We are not proposing a tweak. We are proposing a structural shift: **Project Phalanx**.

**Pillar 1: DEFEND (The Whales)**
*   **For Client A & the Top 250:** No more algorithms. We deploy **SWAT Teams**.
*   We offer **12-Month Price Locks**. We secure the revenue at any cost.

**Pillar 2: FORTIFY (The Core)**
*   **For the other 23,000 clients:** We cannot scale humans. We use **AI**.
*   We give them a free "Competitor Radar" tool. We use "Price Optimization" to auto-bid against competitors.

**Pillar 3: DETECT (The System)**
*   We enable **First-Touch Alerts**. If a competitor pixel fires, we know in 24 hours.

## 🟢 CLOSING
**Speaker Notes:**
We need a **Go/No-Go decision** on the €2.5M investment today to deploy the SWAT teams by Monday.
The cost is €2.5M. The prize is **€76.9M** in protected revenue.
Thank you.
