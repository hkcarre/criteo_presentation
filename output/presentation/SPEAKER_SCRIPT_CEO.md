# CEO Speaker Script: Competitive Strategy & Defense
**Role:** Senior Strategic Partner, McKinsey & Company  
**Audience:** Criteo Executive Committee (ExCo)  
**Date:** January 8, 2026  
**Format:** 10-Minute Strategic Briefing

## 🟢 SLIDE 1: Title & Opening
**(Visual: Title "COMPETITIVE STRATEGY: DEFENDING MARKET")**

**Speaker Notes:**
Good morning. We are here today to address a critical inflexion point in Criteo's market dominance.

While we remain the clear market leader, the data we've uncovered over the last 34 months reveals a systematic, highly aggressive competitive incursion that requires immediate, decisive action.

This is not about panic. It’s about **precision**. We know exactly who they are targeting, where they are winning, and—most importantly—how to stop them.

## 🟢 SLIDE 2: Executive Summary
**(Visual: "We Face Accelerating Competitive Pressure...")**

**Speaker Notes:**
Let’s look at the bottom line.

**The Situation:**
Competitor click share has eroded significantly—from 94% dominance in 2022 down to 73% today. We are strongest in Fashion and Entertainment, but we are bleeding in other sectors.

**The Complication:**
The threat is accelerating. Competitor share didn't just crawl up; it **jumped 4x** starting in Q2 2023. We are seeing a 10.5% year-over-year increase in their volume.

**The Resolution:**
We have identified high-vulnerability verticals (Equipment, Classifieds, Travel Services). Our recommendation is a "3-Tier Defense" strategy focusing on immediate protection of our revenue core.

**Key Metric to Note:**
Competitors now hold **27.1%** of click share in our active markets. This is the new reality we must reverse.

## 🟢 SLIDE 3: Threat Evolution
**(Visual: "Competitors Now Capture ≥27.1% of Click Volume")**

**Speaker Notes:**
This chart tells the story of the attack.

Look at the trajectory. For a long time, the threat was dormant—hovering around 5%. That was "background noise."

Then, in **April 2023 (Phase 2)**, everything changed. You see that step-change? That wasn't an accident. That was a coordinated effective entry into our market space.

Since then, they have grown +21.3 percentage points. They haven't just taken a nibble; they have taken a quarter of the pie.

**So What?**
If this trend continues unchecked at +10.5% YoY, they will cross 35-40% share within 18 months. At that point, they stop being a "competitor" and start being a "replacement." We must break this line *now*.

## 🟢 SLIDE 4: Competitor Launches (Trajectory)
**(Visual: "Competitive Penetration Has Reached 13.2%...")**

**Speaker Notes:**
Is this just churn? Are they winning a client and then losing them?

**No.**

This "Layer Cake" chart proves stickiness. Keep your eye on the **Blue area** (2022 Cohort). It’s not shrinking. That means the clients they won three years ago... they *kept*.

The **Orange area** (2023) stacked on top. The **Light Orange** (2024) stacked on top of that.

**Key Insight:** The threat is **layering**. They are retaining their wins and effectively conquering new territory. They are not just raiding; they are occupying.

## 🟢 SLIDE 5: Market Landscape (Heatmap)
**(Visual: "Southern Europe Bleeds Fastest...")**

**Speaker Notes:**
Where do we fight? We cannot boil the ocean. We must follow the money.

Look at **Eastern Europe** and **Iberia**.
- **Eastern Europe:** €9.2M at risk. 27.5% competitor share.
- **Iberia:** €6.3M at risk. A staggering 34.3% competitor share.

Together, these two regions represent nearly **60% of our total risk exposure**.

Contrast that with Russia (bottom row). High share percentage, but negligible revenue value (€0.4M).

**Strategic Decision:**
We will treat Russia as a distraction. We will deploy our "P1 Critical" resources to Eastern Europe and Spain/Portugal. That is where the war will be won or lost.

---

## 🟢 SLIDE 6: High-Risk Clients (Top 20)
**(Visual: "20 Clients Hold Estimated €39.5M at Risk")**

**Speaker Notes:**
This is the most actionable slide in the deck.

We have identified **20 specific clients** that account for **60% of our total risk**.

Just 20 phone calls.

These aren't just "at risk"—12 of them are rapidly deteriorating (>50% trend).
Client #1 alone is a Large Retailer with €2.4M on the line.

**My Recommendation:**
We need white-glove, CEO-level intervention here. These accounts shouldn't just get an email from a junior AM. They need to hear from leadership. We need to lock these down in the next 30 days.

## 🟢 SLIDE 7: Recommendations (Part 1 - Defense)
**(Visual: "Defense Beats Offense...")**

**Speaker Notes:**
So, here is the plan. Phase 1 is **Defense**.

**Priority 1: Protect High-Value Clients.**
*   **Target:** Those Top 20 clients.
*   **Action:** Senior account teams deployed immediately. Custom commercial terms. Executive sponsorship.
*   **Impact:** Protects €23.7M in revenue.

**Priority 2: Fortify Threatened Segments.**
*   **Target:** Eastern Europe & Iberia.
*   **Action:** Market-specific task forces. Pricing adjustments for "at-risk" verticals.
*   **Impact:** Halting the share bleed.

In a mature market, retention delivers **3x the ROI** of acquisition. Defending this revenue is the most profitable thing we can do this quarter.

---

## 🟢 SLIDE 8: Recommendations (Part 2 - Innovation)
**(Visual: "Speed and Innovation...")**

**Speaker Notes:**
Phase 2 is about change.

**Priority 3: Early Warning System.**
We were too slow to see this rise. We need automated "First Touch" detection. When a competitor lands 1 click on a client, our AMs should know within 24 hours—not 3 months later in a QBR review.

**Priority 4: Product Differentiation.**
The fact that they *can* replace us means we are becoming commoditized. We must accelerate R&D to build features they simply cannot copy—creating "ecosystem lock-in" (integrations, exclusive data) that makes leaving Criteo technically painful, not just commercially inconvenient.

---

## 🟢 CLOSING
**Speaker Notes:**
To summarize:
1.  The threat is real and accelerating (+10.5% YoY).
2.  The damage is concentrated (Top 20 clients, Southern/Eastern Europe).
3.  The solution is focused defense and rapid detection.

We are asking for immediate approval to redeploy resources to the "P1 Critical" zones starting Monday.

Thank you.
