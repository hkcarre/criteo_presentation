# CEO Speaker Script: Project Phalanx
**Role:** Senior Strategic Partner, McKinsey & Company  
**Audience:** Criteo Executive Committee (ExCo)  
**Date:** January 11, 2026  
**Format:** 10-Minute Strategic Briefing

## 🟢 SLIDE 1: Title
**(Visual: "COMPETITIVE STRATEGY: DEFENDING MARKET")**

**Speaker Notes:**
Gentlemen, competitors are growing at **+27% YoY** in our market. While our quantified risk model shows **€6.7M** in addressable revenue at risk, the strategic risk is **losing category leadership**. 
In **April 2023**, the market rules changed. While we were optimizing for efficiency, competitors started layering new clients.
Our Realized Drag model proves that for every **2 competitor clicks**, we lose **1 Euro** of revenue. This isn't market expansion—it's **targeted cannibalization** of mid-market clients.
**We are here to secure our position as the category leader, not become a fast follower.**

## 🟢 SLIDE 2: Strategic Executive Brief
**(Visual: "Situation / Complication / Resolution" Memo)**

**Speaker Notes:**
Gentlemen, Slide 2 is the strategy in a single page. 
**The Situation:** On paper, we are market leaders. In reality, we are bleeding in the deep water.
**The Complication:** That **+27%** competitor growth is not random market noise. While they are penetrating deeper into our mid-market (13.6% share vs 5.8% in our whales), **90% of our revenue risk is concentrated in our Top 10%** because these accounts drive 77% of our revenue.
**The Resolution:** We must pivot to a **"Bifurcated Defense"**: SWAT Teams for Whales, **Agentic AI** for Mid-Market. Investment: **€1.5M**. Total Value: **€4.5M**. **ROI: 3.0x** Blended (Defense + Growth).

## 🟢 SLIDE 3: Situation Assessment
**(Visual: "The €132M Opportunity")**

**Speaker Notes:**
Here is the bottom line.
**The Risk:** Our Realized Drag model quantifies **€6.7M** in addressable revenue risk. This is the data-validated figure using market-specific cannibalization coefficients.
**The Reality:** The "Efficiency Trap" is real. While competitors have **higher penetration** in mid-market (13.6% share vs 5.8% in whales), **90% of revenue loss** is concentrated in our Top 10% because these accounts drive 77% of our revenue.
**The Opportunity:** Project Phalanx recaptures **€2.67M in Year 1** (40% of addressable risk) while positioning Criteo as the **first mover** in Agentic Advertising.
**The Response:** **3-Pillar Strategy**: DEFEND (Top 50 whales via SWAT Teams), FORTIFY (23K mid-market via Agentic AI), DETECT (AI-powered competitor alerts).

## 🟢 SLIDE 4: Threat Evolution
**(Visual: "Competitors Now Capture ≥27.1% of Click Share")**

**Speaker Notes:**
This chart tells the story of the attack.
For years, the threat was dormant (5%). Then, in **April 2023**, it exploded.
**The Catalyst:** This marked a **structural shift**. Multiple competitors simultaneously intensified efforts (likely due to Series D funding rounds), creating a coordinated surge.
Competitors have gained **+21.3 points** of click share.
**Key Insight:** They are growing at **+27% YoY** (Oct '23 -> Oct '24). If we do nothing, they become a "replacement" option within 18 months.

 ## 🟢 SLIDE 4b: The Counterfactual (Forecast)
 **(Visual: "If We Do Nothing: -€180M vs -€30M")**
 
 **Speaker Notes:**
 If we do nothing, the math is simple.
 *   **Competitor Share:** Explodes from **27% to 45%**.
 *   **Revenue Impact:** We lose **€180M** annually by 2026.
 *   **Our Status:** We become a "Niche Player" in our own market.
 **Project Phalanx limits the damage to -€30M while we build the Agentic AI moat.**

 ## 🟢 SLIDE 5: Competitor Launches (Trajectory)
**(Visual: "Competitive Penetration Has Reached 13.2%...")**

**Speaker Notes:**
A fair question: Is this just normal churn? Are they winning a client and then losing them?
**No.**
This "Layer Cake" chart proves stickiness. Keep your eye on the **Blue area** (2022 Cohort). It’s not shrinking. That means the clients they won three years ago... they *kept*.
**Key Insight:** The threat is **layering**. They are retaining their wins and effectively occupying new territory every quarter.

## 🟢 SLIDE 6: Market Landscape (Fortress vs. Flank)
**(Visual: "Southern Europe Bleeds Fastest")**

**Speaker Notes:**
Geographically, the war is asymmetric.
**Fortress Markets (UK, FR):** We are safe. Low risk.
**Flank Markets (ES, IT, Eastern Europe):** We are bleeding. Spain is at **34%** competitor share. Eastern Europe at **27.5%**.
**The Russia Anomaly:** You see Russia with **38% Click Share** (Volume) but only **0.8% Detection** (Reach).
*Interpretation:* They have deep penetration in a handful of massive Russian accounts. We will MONITOR Russia, but we must FIGHT in Spain where the threat is broader.

## 🟢 SLIDE 7: Market Perception (Sentiment Gap)
**(Visual: "The Legacy Giant vs Agile Challengers")**

**Speaker Notes:**
The data tells us *what* is happening. The sentiment analysis tells us *why*.
**Criteo:** We are seen as "Unrivaled Scale" but "Expensive & Bureaucratic."
**Challengers:** They are seen as "Agile," offering "Black Box" performance that outperforms us in specific niches.
**The Gap:** We are losing on SERVICE. Smaller clients feel ignored ("Ghost Support"). This is why we need to automate the Core (Fortify) to free up humans for the Whales (Defend).

## 🟢 SLIDE 8: Risk Waterfall - Project Phalanx Defends 82% of Risk
**(Visual: "From €13.5M Validated Risk to €2.5M Net Exposure")**

**Speaker Notes:**
**This waterfall tells the complete story of Project Phalanx in one chart.**

Let me walk you through the five components:

1. **Validated Risk (€13.5M)** - This is our data-validated exposure using country-specific Drag Coefficients. We've applied conservative caps (risk cannot exceed client revenue), making this CFO-ready.

2. **Defense (-€7.5M)** - The combined impact of our SWAT Teams (Top 50 Whales) and Agentic AI deployment (mid-market). This defensive layer cuts our exposure in half.

3. **Residual Risk (€6.0M)** - What remains after our defensive tactics. This is the portion we cannot prevent through direct intervention.

4. **AI Upside (+€3.5M)** - Here's where it gets interesting. Our First-Mover Advantage with Agentic AI doesn't just defend—it creates incremental revenue through 24/7 personalization at zero marginal cost.

5. **Final Net Risk (€2.5M)** - The bottom line: **82% risk mitigation**. We've reduced €13.5M down to €2.5M net exposure while creating €3.5M in AI-driven upside.

**The Strategic Insight:** This isn't just defense—it's a transformation. We're using AI innovation to pay for whale protection, achieving a **5.4x risk reduction** while positioning Criteo as the category leader in Agentic Advertising.

## 🟢 SLIDE 9: Recommendation (Project Phalanx)
**(Visual: "Bifurcated Defense: White Glove vs AI")**

**Speaker Notes:**
We are not proposing a tweak. We are proposing a structural shift: **Project Phalanx**.

**Pillar 1: DEFEND (The Whales) - Investment: €400K**
*   **For the Top 50:** No more algorithms. We deploy **SWAT Teams** (3 Senior AMs).
*   We offer **12-Month Price Locks** (via self-serve portal).
*   **Target:** 60% recapture of Top 50 whale risk (€3.8M addressable).

**Pillar 2: FORTIFY (The Core) - Investment: €600K**
*   **For the 23,000 Mid-Market clients:** We cannot scale humans. Agentic AI scales infinitely.
*   **First Mover Advantage:** We deploy **Agentic AI Agents**—autonomous, not static. While competitors use scripts, we use intelligence.
*   **Target:** 35% recapture (Defense).
*   **Upside:** First Movers see **10% Revenue Uplift**. On our risk pool, that is an incremental **€1.9M** in sales.

**Pillar 3: DETECT (The System) - Investment: €100K**
*   AI-powered **First-Touch Alerts**. Competitor pixel fires → we know in 24 hours → auto-trigger retention campaign.

## 🟢 CLOSING
**Speaker Notes:**
We need a decision **this week** on the €1.5M investment. Here's why:
*   **Financial ROI:** **3.0x Blended** (1.8x Defense + 1.2x Growth). This is credible and pays for itself in Q1.
*   **Strategic ROI:** We are using the "Growth" (AI Optimization) to pay for the "Defense". We solve the scale problem permanently.
*   **Client A Renewal:** Feb 1st (21 days away). Loss = Q1 target miss.
*   **SWAT Deployment:** 7 days to spin up.

If we approve by Friday, we deploy Monday. The financial case is strong. The strategic case is **priceless**.

**What is your decision?**

Thank you.
