## 🟢 SLIDE 1: Title
**(Visual: "COMPETITIVE STRATEGY: DEFENDING MARKET")**

**30-SECOND OPENING:**

"We have €13.5 million in validated revenue at risk. That's not an estimate—it's CFO-ready, data-validated exposure from 24,000 active clients showing competitor pixels on their sites.

**But here's what matters:** Project Phalanx doesn't just defend that €13.5M. It reduces our net exposure to €2.5M—an 82% risk mitigation—while creating €3.5M in AI-driven upside. That's a 5.4x risk reduction with positive ROI.

**The decision today:** €1.5M investment. Deploy in 7 days. Category leadership secured.

Let me show you the data."

## 🟢 SLIDE 2: Strategic Executive Brief
**(Visual: "Situation / Complication / Resolution" Memo)**

**Speaker Notes:**

This single slide frames the entire strategy.

**SITUATION:** Competitors are growing at +27% YoY in our market. They've gained 21.3 points of click share since April 2023. We're still the market leader, but the gap is closing fast.

**COMPLICATION:** Our €92.6M exposed revenue base faces €13.5M in quantified risk. The threat isn't evenly distributed—19% of our revenue (€17.9M) sits with just 50 whale clients. If we lose momentum in whales while competitors layer the mid-market, we lose category leadership.

**RESOLUTION:** Project Phalanx. A dual-strategy defense: SWAT Teams for the Top 50 Whales + Agentic AI for 23,000 mid-market clients. Investment: €1.5M. Impact: 82% risk mitigation + €3.5M AI upside.

---

## 🟢 SLIDE 3: Situation Assessment  
**(Visual: "€92.6M Revenue Exposure / €13.5M Validated Risk")**

**Speaker Notes:**

Let me calibrate the threat precisely.

**Total Exposure:** €92.6M in annual revenue across clients showing competitor activity.

**Validated Risk:** €13.5M. This is our conservative, capped risk model—competitor-driven revenue loss cannot exceed actual client revenue. CFO-approved methodology.

**Whale Concentration:** €17.9M (19% of total) concentrated in just 50 accounts. This is where we're most vulnerable.

**The Asymmetry:** While competitors have higher penetration in mid-market (13.6% average share), 19% of our revenue sits with whales where even small share losses create massive impact.

**Project Phalanx Response:** We defend both segments with the right tools—human intelligence for whales, artificial intelligence for scale.

## 🟢 SLIDE 4: Threat Evolution
**(Visual: "Competitors Now Capture 27.1% of Click Share")**

**Speaker Notes:**

This chart shows when the war started: **April 2023**.

For years, competitors hovered at 5% share—noise level. Then they surged to 27.1% in 21 months. That's a coordinated attack, likely fueled by Series D funding rounds across multiple players.

**The Growth Rate:** +27% YoY (Oct '23 → Oct '24). At this trajectory, they become a "replacement option" within 18 months.

**The Inflection Point:** April 2023 wasn't gradual—it was structural. Multiple competitors intensified simultaneously. This is strategic, not opportunistic.

**Our Response Window:** We have 12-18 months before the category perception shifts from "Criteo + Challengers" to "Fragmented Market." Project Phalanx closes that window.

## 🟢 SLIDE 5: Competitor Launches (Cohort Stickiness)
**(Visual: "Competitive Penetration Layering Over Time")**

**Speaker Notes:**

The critical question: Are they churning their wins, or keeping them?

**Answer:** They're keeping them. 

Look at the blue area—2022 cohort. It's not shrinking. That means clients won three years ago are still active on competitor platforms today.

**The Insight:** This is **layering**, not churn-and-replace. They're retaining wins and adding new territory every quarter. Each cohort becomes permanent market share loss.

**Why This Matters:** If they were churning, we could wait them out. But permanent layering means every quarter we delay, we lose ground we'll never recover.

---

## 🟢 SLIDE 6: Market Landscape (Geographic War Map)
**(Visual: "Southern Europe Bleeds Fastest")**

**Speaker Notes:**

Geographically, this is an asymmetric war.

**Fortress Markets (UK, France):** Low competitor share (17-20%). We're defended.

**Battleground Markets (Spain, Italy, Eastern Europe):** High competitor share (29-34%). We're bleeding.

**The Russia Anomaly:** 38% click share but only 0.8% client detection. Translation: Deep penetration in a handful of massive accounts, not broad market threat.

**Strategic Implication:** We MONITOR Russia. We FIGHT in Southern Europe where the threat is broad-based and growing.

**Phalanx Priority:** Deploy SWAT teams to Spain and Italy first—highest risk, highest ROI.

## 🟢 SLIDE 7: Market Perception (The Service Gap)
**(Visual: "Legacy Giant vs Agile Challengers")**

**Speaker Notes:**

The data tells us *what* is happening. Sentiment analysis tells us *why*.

**Criteo's Brand:** "Unrivaled Scale" but "Expensive & Bureaucratic."

**Challengers' Brand:** "Agile" with "Black Box Performance" that wins in specific niches.

**The Gap We're Losing On:** SERVICE. Mid-market clients report "ghost support"—they feel ignored. Meanwhile, whales get the same cookie-cutter account management as everyone else.

**Why Phalanx Solves This:** We bifurcate. Automate the mid-market with 24/7 Agentic AI (better service at zero marginal cost). Elevate whales to true SWAT-level human attention. Both segments win.

## 🟢 SLIDE 8: Risk Waterfall - Project Phalanx Defends 82% of Risk
**(Visual: "From €13.5M Validated Risk to €2.5M Net Exposure")**

**Speaker Notes:**

This waterfall is the complete story in one chart. Five components:

**1. Validated Risk (€13.5M)** – Our CFO-ready exposure using country-specific drag coefficients. Risk capped at actual client revenue—fully defensible.

**2. Defense (-€7.5M)** – The power of dual strategy. SWAT Teams lock the whales. Agentic AI retains mid-market. Combined impact: we cut risk in half.

**3. Residual Risk (€6.0M)** – What remains after defensive tactics. The portion we cannot prevent through direct intervention alone.

**4. AI Upside (+€3.5M)** – The game-changer. First-mover advantage with Agentic AI doesn't just defend—it *creates* incremental revenue through 24/7 personalization at zero marginal cost.

**5. Final Net Risk (€2.5M)** – The bottom line. **82% risk mitigation.** From €13.5M down to €2.5M net exposure.

**The Strategic Unlock:** AI innovation pays for whale protection. We achieve 5.4x risk reduction while positioning Criteo as the category leader in Agentic Advertising.

## 🟢 SLIDE 9: Recommendation (Project Phalanx)
**(Visual: "Bifurcated Defense: White Glove vs AI")**

**Speaker Notes:**

We are not proposing a tweak. We are proposing a **structural transformation.**

**PILLAR 1: DEFEND (Top 50 Whales) – €400K Investment**
- Deploy 3 Senior AM SWAT Teams dedicated exclusively to Top 50
- Offer 12-month pricing locks via self-serve portal (removes friction)
- Target: 60% recapture of €3.4M whale risk = €2.0M defended

**PILLAR 2: LEAD WITH INNOVATION (23K Mid-Market) – €1.0M Investment**
- Deploy Agentic AI Agents—autonomous, not scripted
- First-mover advantage: competitors use chatbots, we use intelligence
- 24/7 availability at zero marginal cost
- Target: Defend €5.5M base + create €3.5M AI-driven upside

**PILLAR 3: DETECT (Early Warning System) – €100K Investment**
- Real-time competitor alerts: pixel fires → AM notification in <24 hours
- Churn probability scoring (ML-powered, daily updates)
- Target: -50% response time lag

**Combined Impact:**
- **Defense ROI:** €7.5M risk mitigated / €1.5M investment = 5.0x
- **Total Value Creation:** €11.0M (€7.5M defense + €3.5M AI upside)
- **Net ROI:** 7.3x blended

## 🟢 SLIDE 10: Alert System Design
**(Visual: "Real-Time Detection Architecture")**

**Speaker Notes:**

Pillar 3 deserves its own slide—this is our early warning system.

**Core Metrics:**
- Competitor first-touch detection (pixel fires)
- Click share delta (month-over-month)
- Revenue velocity (3-month trend)

**Decision Logic:**
- **P1 CRITICAL (24h SLA):** High-value client (>€100K) + (First Touch OR Share Delta >5%)
- **P2 MONITOR (72h SLA):** Mid-market + (Share >10% OR Revenue Drop >10%)

**Delivery Channels:**
- P1: Slack instant alert + VP Sales email
- P2: Daily digest to Account Manager

**Success Metrics:**
- >75% alert precision (verified threats)
- <24h response time (down from 90 days today)
- €5M+ retention impact per year

**The Transformation:** From "post-mortem analysis" (discovering churn 3 months late) to "real-time intervention" (acting within 24 hours).

## 🟢 CLOSING: The Decision
**Speaker Notes:**

We need a decision this week. Here's why timing matters:

**Financial Case:**
- Investment: €1.5M
- Year 1 Impact: €11.0M (€7.5M defense + €3.5M AI upside)
- ROI: 7.3x blended
- Payback: <3 months

**Strategic Case:**
- Category leadership position secured
- First-mover advantage in Agentic AI advertising
- Permanent competitive moat (AI compounds, humans don't)

**Urgency:**
- Top whale renewals: Next 60 days
- Competitor trajectory: +27% YoY growth
- SWAT team deployment: 7 days from approval

**The Choice:**
- Approve: Deploy Monday. Lock whales. Launch AI. Lead category.
- Delay: Lose Q1 momentum. Become fast follower. Fight uphill for 2 years.

**This isn't a cost center. This is strategic offense disguised as defense.**

What is your decision?

**Thank you.**
