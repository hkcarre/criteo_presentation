# Criteo Presentation - Final Enhancements Summary

## 🎨 Latest Updates (January 8, 2026 - 17:43)

### Official Criteo SVG Logo Integration
✅ **Replaced text-based logo with official SVG**
- Source: `criteo-logo-orange (1).svg`
- Applied to all 11 slides
- Proper sizing and positioning (top-right corner)
- Maintains orange brand color (#FE5000)

### McKinsey Storytelling - "SO WHAT?" Boxes
Added impactful insight boxes to 7 key slides:

**Slide 2 - Executive Summary**
> "While Criteo maintains market leadership, accelerating competitive pressure demands immediate defensive action—particularly in high-vulnerability segments where we risk permanent revenue loss."

**Slide 3 - Threat Evolution**
> "The threat isn't just growing—it's accelerating. Without intervention, we project double-digit revenue erosion within 18 months, requiring both immediate triage and systemic competitive response."

**Slide 4 - Competitor Launches**
> "Competitor launch acceleration signals market maturation and product commoditization. Early warning systems are no longer optional—they're essential for survival."

**Slide 5 - Market Landscape**
> "Geographic clustering reveals systematic vulnerabilities. Southern European markets require dedicated competitive taskforces with market-specific playbooks to stem revenue hemorrhaging."

**Slide 6 - High-Risk Clients**
> "€39.5M in concentrated risk means losing just 5 clients could trigger 10%+ revenue decline. These 20 accounts demand white-glove, CEO-level intervention within 30 days."

**Slide 7 - Recommendations**
> "Defense beats offense in mature markets. Protecting existing revenue (€23.7M) delivers 3x ROI vs. new customer acquisition—making retention the highest-leverage growth strategy available."

**Slide 9 - Alert System**
> "Speed wins in competitive defense. Real-time alerts compress response time from weeks to hours—the difference between retaining and losing a €2M+ account."

### Accessibility & Contrast Fixes
✅ **Fixed readability issues:**
- Metric labels: Changed from gray to black (better contrast on light backgrounds)
- Summary slide: All text properly white on dark background
- No more dark text on dark backgrounds
- No more light text on light backgrounds
- WCAG AA compliance for color contrast

### Brand Elements Applied
✅ **Complete Criteo brand compliance:**
- Official SVG logo on all slides
- Orange-to-blue gradient top bar
- Criteo orange (#FF5722) accents throughout
- Arial typography (Criteo standard)
- Clean, minimalist layout with white space
- Consistent footer branding
