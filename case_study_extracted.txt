Data Analyst Solutions & Innovation – Case Study
You are free & encouraged to use any tools (programming languages, excel, AI) you deem useful to analyse the case.
Introduction to the Dataset
This dataset provides insight into Criteo’s business performance across different clients, markets,
verticals, and segments. It includes competitor activity and rough-estimated revenue loss attributed to
competitor launches.
This dataset is semi-real, clients and revenue figures have been masked. The data hasn’t been cleaned
and some exploration should be needed before you find insights. There will be certain anomalies – feel
free to drop them (with justification) & Feel free to highlight any data-quality issues you encountered
and explain your next-step.
Columns in the Dataset:
1. Month: The timeframe (on a monthly basis) for each data point.
2. Client id: This is unique identifier for Criteo clients.
3. Market: The country where the activity took place.
4. Vertical: The industry category (e.g., "Home & Garden", "CE & Technology").
5. Segment: Client segments that are determined based on spend (e.g., "Small", "Extra-Small").
6. Revenue (in Euros): Total revenue generated by Criteo for that client in that month
7. Competitor Clicks: The number of clicks attributed to competitors. This is estimated data based
on UTMs, so it’s indicative rather than precise.
8. Criteo Clicks: The number of clicks on Criteo campaigns for that client in that month. You can
compare this with competitor clicks to understand relative market presence.
9. Revenue Per Click: The average cost that a client pays per Criteo click.
10. Estimated Revenue Lost: An estimation of how much revenue Criteo potentially lost due to
competitor actions. This estimate is based on multiplying our Revenue per click by Competitor
clicks. So it’s a rough indication rather than precise

Objective:
Imagine that you are to be present to the CEO of Criteo on the topic of Competition, and the threat that
we’re facing from them. You should prepare a presentation of approximately 15-20 mins allowing for
10-15 minutes for questions – The case shouldn’t take longer than 4-6 hours to prepare, and we really
appreciate every minute you dedicate to it!
To help guide your presentation, it should cover the following areas:
• Show how the competitive threat has evolved over the analysis period. Choose and justify a
metric that best represents that threat
• How does competition launches (competitor seen for the first time) evolve on Criteo over the
analysis period?
• Identify Markets, Verticals, or Segments that are notably more threatened than average.
• Are there any clients we should pay particular attention too? If so, why?
• What recommendations do you have for the CEO for mitigating the competition threat?
• Design, at a high level, an alert system for our commercial teams when a competitor first
appears on their client’s account.
• In 1 slide, outline: (a) the metrics you’d use, (b) the decision logic or thresholds, (c) the
delivery channel & format of the alert, and (d) how you’d measure the alert’s
effectiveness.
